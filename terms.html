    <h3>WonderBill Terms and Conditions ("Terms")</h3>

    <p>Last updated: 2<sup>nd</sup> August 2017<br>

    Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully
    before using the www.wonderbill.com website (the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;) and the
    my.wonderbill.com application (the &ldquo;App&rdquo;) (the App and the Website
    together, or individually, the "Service"). The Service is operated by WonderBill
    Limited d/b/a as WonderBill ("WonderBill", "us", "we", or "our"), a company
    registered in England and Wales. Our company registration number is 10515447 and our
    registered office is at Shell Centre, Shell Centre, London, England, SE1 7NA.</p>

    <p>These Terms are a legal contract between you and WonderBill ("us" or "our" or "we"
    or &ldquo;WonderBill&rdquo;) and govern your access to and use of the Service and any
    the text, data, information, software, graphics, videos, photographs and more (all of
    which are referred to as &ldquo;Materials&rdquo;) that we and our affiliates may make
    available to you through Service.</p>

    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and
    compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who
    wish to access or use the Service.</p>

    <p>READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING ANY PART OF THE SERVICE.
    USING THE SERVICE IN ANY WAY INDICATES THAT YOU HAVE BOTH READ AND ACCEPT THESE
    TERMS. YOU CANNOT USE THIS SERVICE OR ANY PART OF THE SERVICE IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT
    THESE TERMS.</p>

    <h3>User restrictions and access</h3>

    <p>You must be 18 years old or older to access or use the Service. Be aware that the
    use of some of the functionalities of the Service requires access to the
    internet.</p>

    <p>The features of the Service are more particularly described on Website. In
    general, the Service simplifies and helps you manage your relationships with third
    party service providers such as energy, TV, Internet and phone (collectively,
    &ldquo;Providers&rdquo;). Once signed up, key account, usage and statement
    information that you upload or otherwise connect to within the Service (the
    &ldquo;Data&rdquo;) is available centrally through your WonderBill account.</p>

    <p>You can also set up notifications to receive an overview of all of your account
    activity on a periodic basis, or whenever activity of interest takes place. Based on
    the Data within your WonderBill account, we may also make recommendations to you,
    such as to help you run your Provider relationships more efficiently and to provide
    money saving recommendations.</p>

    <p>We will not charge you for access to the Service. To sign up, you will need to
    create an account by following the instructions on the Website. Once your account has
    been created, you can provide your online account details for the specific Providers
    you use and then view information pertaining to those services within your WonderBill
    account. The more Providers you add, the more useful the Service will be.</p>

    <h3>Your Account</h3>

    <p>When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of
    18, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all
    times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate
    termination of your account on the Service.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and
    password, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer
    and/or account. You agree to accept responsibility for any and all activities or
    actions that occur under your account and/or password, whether your password is with
    our Service or a third-party service. You must notify us immediately upon becoming
    aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

    <h3>WonderBill as Your Limited Agent</h3>

    <p>By using the Service, you authorise and appoint WonderBill as your limited agent,
    solely for the purposes of accessing the Provider accounts you designate and the
    information contained within them, on your behalf, and, where specifically requested
    by you, assisting you in changing Providers where available. You appoint WonderBill
    as your limited agent for the foregoing purposes, with the full power and authority,
    to access any and all information relating to those designated accounts, through all
    means including access to third party sites, servers and documents and other means of
    information retrieval relating to you. For all intents and purposes, WonderBill is
    acting as you would act in person.</p>

    <p>You agree that when WonderBill accesses and retrieves information from third
    parties relating to you, WonderBill is acting as on your behalf and not the agent of
    the third party or any other entity.</p>

    <p>You agree that third parties can rely on the authorisation granted by you to us
    and that the Service is not endorsed by any third party Providers accessible through
    the Service. We do not warrant or otherwise guarantee that such third parties permit
    use of our Service as part of any agreement you have in place with them.</p>

    <h3>Data</h3>

    <p>You license WonderBill to store any usernames, passwords, data and other content
    relating to you, which are obtained from Providers and or which are contained within
    your WonderBill account by virtue of your use of the Service. The license provided by
    you to us is without the payment by us of any fees.</p>

    <p>In general, WonderBill will use the Data in order to: (i) provide the Service to
    you; and (ii) look at ways in which we can improve the Service; and (iii) analyse
    overall trends in usage of Providers, in an anonymised and aggregated manner (meaning
    that you cannot be personally identified), which we may share with third parties. For
    more information, please review our Privacy Policy, available at <a href="https://my.wonderbill.com/privacy" title="Privacy Policy">my.wonderbill.com/privacy</a> and incorporated by reference into these Terms.</p>

    install and use the Service (each a &ldquo;Device&rdquo;). By using the Service, you
    agree that we may communicate with you by electronic means to your mobile Device,
    including via in-App notices and/or push notifications. You further agree that

    forth in the WonderBill Privacy Policy, and, we may in accordance with applicable law

    App, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii)

    any third-party or use the App to provide time sharing or similar services for any
    third-party; (iii) make any copies of the App; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable,

    other proprietary rights notices on the App. You acknowledge that we may from time to
    time issue upgraded versions of the App, and may automatically electronically upgrade
    the version of the App that you are using on your Device. You consent to such
    automatic upgrading on your Device, and agree that these Terms will apply to all such
    upgrades. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the App or any copy thereof,
    and we and our third-party licensors or suppliers retain all right, title, and
    interest in and to the App (and any copy of the App). Standard carrier data charges
    may apply to your use of the App.</p>

      possession and use of our iOS App.</li>

      <li>You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is

      beneficiaries to these Terms as they relate to your license of our iOS App. Upon

      have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as they relate to your
      license of the iOS App as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</li>
    </ul>
